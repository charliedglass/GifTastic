This is the GifTastic App!  

With my app, you can search for your favorite superhero in the textbox.  When you submit, the app searches the term in the <b>GIPHY API</b>, and attaches that necessary info to a button.

Now, you can just click on any of the buttons to show 10 gifs of that superhero!

Have fun!
